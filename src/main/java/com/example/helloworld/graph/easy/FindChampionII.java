 * leetcode 2924. Find Champion II , inDegree , Google Interview Question
 *
 * Code Harmony Video Explanation : https://youtu.be/MhJe8gntZPM
 *
 * There are n teams numbered from 0 to n - 1 in a tournament; each team is also a node in a DAG.
 *
 * You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed 2D integer array edges of length m representing the DAG, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is a directed edge from team ui to team vi in the graph.
 *
 * A directed edge from a to b in the graph means that team a is stronger than team b and team b is weaker than team a.
 *
 * Team a will be the champion of the tournament if there is no team b that is stronger than team a.
 *
 * Return the team that will be the champion of the tournament if there is a unique champion, otherwise, return -1.
 *
 * Notes
 *
 * A cycle is a series of nodes a1, a2, ..., an, an+1 such that node a1 is the same node as node an+1, the nodes a1, a2, ..., an are distinct, and there is a directed edge from the node ai to node ai+1 for every i in the range [1, n].
 * A DAG is a directed graph that does not have any cycle.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Team 1 is weaker than team 0. Team 2 is weaker than team 1. So the champion is team 0.
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: Team 2 is weaker than team 0 and team 1. Team 3 is weaker than team 1. But team 1 and team 0 are not weaker than any other teams. So the answer is -1.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * m == edges.length
 * 0 <= m <= n * (n - 1) / 2
 * edges[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= edge[i][j] <= n - 1
 * edges[i][0] != edges[i][1]
 * The input is generated such that if team a is stronger than team b, team b is not stronger than team a.
 * The input is generated such that if team a is stronger than team b and team b is stronger than team c, then team a is stronger than team c.
